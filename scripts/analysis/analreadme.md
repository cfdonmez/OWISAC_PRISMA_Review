#(OWC Cascaded Topology & HW Profile)

Extract the paper’s cascaded optical architecture and hardware profile in one structured line, prioritizing Methods/System Design/Experimental Setup and figure captions. The line must include, in order, Topology=…; OPA=…; RIS=… and, if applicable, ISAC=…. For Topology use one of OPA->RIS, OPA<->RIS, multi-hop, or hybrid; if multiple architectures are described, separate them with a vertical bar. Under OPA, report technology (SiPh/SiN/III-V), phase\_bits, scan\_range in degrees with ± if given, HPBW in degrees, steering\_rate in kHz, and channels. Under RIS, report class (LCoS/DMD/meta/EO), pixels, phase\_bits, switch\_time in ms or us, efficiency in percent, and aperture in cm^2. For ISAC, state coupling or method (e.g., waveform-reuse, TDM, FDM, CDM). If the architecture is not described, write Not specified; if the work is RF-only, write Non-optical (RF-only). End the line with an evidence anchor showing the exact source location, such as (p.X, Fig.Y) or (Sec.Z). Example output: Topology=OPA->RIS; OPA=SiPh, 6-bit, ±60 deg, HPBW=0.8 deg, 1.2 kHz, 512 ch; RIS=LCoS, 16000 px, 8-bit, 3 ms, 42%, 25 cm^2; ISAC=OFDM waveform-reuse (p.7, Fig.3).

#challenges

Identify all technical challenges the authors explicitly state or strongly imply in the paper. Prioritize explicit statements; if a challenge is inferred, flag it with “potentially” or “suggested.” For each challenge, produce a single-line entry that includes a clear category, a concise description, the experimental or modeling context (e.g., λ, distance z, LoS/NLoS, r0/Cn^2/σR^2, hardware settings), the potential impact expressed with a metric and direction, and any mitigation proposed by the authors; end every entry with an evidence anchor showing the exact source location (p./Fig./Sec.). Use consistent categories such as alignment/calibration, phase retrieval or channel estimation, turbulence/scintillation (r0, Cn^2, σR^2), NLoS multipath/scattering/blockage, grating lobes/aliasing, hardware limits (phase bits, switching speed, efficiency, power/eye safety), computational cost/latency/memory, and dataset/ground-truth limitations. Quantify wherever possible (BER/SNR/EVM deltas, PSL/ISLR/HPBW changes, data rate or latency shifts) and keep units. Format: Challenge=<type>: <description> (Context=<key conditions>; Impact=<brief metric change>; Mitigation=<method or NA>) (p.X, Fig.Y or Sec.Z). Example: Challenge=Turbulence: r0 reduction from 12 cm to 6 cm increases scintillation and raises BER at 1 km (Context=λ=1550 nm, outdoor NLoS; Cn^2≈1e−14 m−2/3); Impact=BER +2e−3 @ SNR=15 dB; Mitigation=robust pre-shaping E−αVar (Sec.4.2).

#Signal Processing and Targeting Cap

Extract the system’s dynamic targeting and signal-processing capabilities in a single, structured line, prioritizing Methods/Implementation/Results. Report OPA steering range with ± in degrees, steering rate in kHz, targeting accuracy (degrees or meters) if given, RIS reconfiguration speed in ms or μs and any programmability constraints, and list the core algorithms used (e.g., GS/Fienup, Wirtinger, PhaseLift, deep learning, OFDM/FMCW, MIMO-ISAC) plus how sensing and communication are coupled (reuse/TDM/FDM/CDM). Quantify any SNR/BER/PSL improvements that are attributed to targeting or processing. Format: Capability=<type or module>: <concise description with numbers> (Context=<λ, z, LoS/NLoS, r0/Cn^2 if relevant>) (p./Fig./Sec.). Example: Capability=Targeting: OPA ±50 deg @1.5 kHz, accuracy 0.3 deg; RIS switch=2.8 ms; Algorithms=GS + RIS-coded PR; ISAC=reuse-OFDM (p.6, Fig.4).

#Metrics and Evaluation

 Identify the primary communication and sensing metrics with their absolute values and any comparative improvements over a stated baseline; include conditions such as wavelength, distance, environment, LoS/NLoS, turbulence parameters if reported, and hardware mode. Prefer concrete metrics like data rate/bandwidth, BER/EVM/SNR, spectral/energy efficiency, sensing range or resolution, ROC/CRB, interference suppression. State the comparison method (simulation vs testbed, which baseline) if provided. Format: Metric=<name>: <value units> (Context=<λ, z, LoS/NLoS, r0/Cn^2, setup>) (Improvement=<%/dB vs baseline>) (p./Fig./Sec.). Example: Metric=Data rate: 3.2 Gbps (Context=λ=1550 nm, indoor LoS) (Improvement=+23% vs prior design) (Fig.5).

 #Solutions to Technical Challenges

  Record novel design or algorithmic solutions and tie each to a mechanism and an expected or measured gain on a metric. Name the locus (OPA design, RIS reconfiguration, ISAC coupling, phase retrieval/channel estimation, beam shaping) and give the key idea in one clause, then the benefit with units if available. End with an evidence anchor. Format: Innovation=<type>: <mechanism> (Benefit=<metric change with units or expected effect>) (p./Fig./Sec.). Example: Innovation=BN-RIS placement: Poisson-disk sampling to suppress periodic lobes (Benefit=PSL −7 dB at same pixel count) (Sec.4.2).


  #Wavelength / Band (λ)

#Range & Environment

Extract link distance and environmental context, including indoor/outdoor, urban/fog, and LoS/NLoS. Include obstacles if explicitly noted.

#Channel Impairment Focus

Classify the dominant non-ideal channel condition addressed by the paper and name the mechanism if specified (e.g., single-bounce specular, diffuse, multi-bounce, blockage, fog/smoke/rain, turbulence). If several are considered, list in order of emphasis. Format: Impairment=<type and mechanism> (Scope=<qualitative/quantitative>) (p./Fig./Sec.). Example: Impairment=NLoS (single-bounce specular) (Scope=quantitative) (Fig.2).


#Turbulence Parameters Reported 

 Record any reported turbulence parameters and the adopted model (e.g., Kolmogorov, Rytov), including path length if tied to the parameter. Keep scientific notation and units as given. Format: r0=<value/range>; Cn^2=<value>; σR^2=<value>; Model=<name>; z=<distance if tied> (p./Fig./Sec.). Example: r0=8–12 cm; Cn^2=1e−14–1e−15 m−2/3; Model=Kolmogorov; z=1 km (p.5).

#Phase Retrieval / Channel Estimation

Identify the family of phase retrieval or channel estimation used and any salient settings such as number of coded masks/measurements M, initialization type, iteration count, or training regime. If none is used, write None. Format: PR/CE=<family>; M=<# if coded>; Init=<type>; Iters=<# or NA> (p./Fig./Sec.). Example: PR/CE=RIS-coded GS; M=8; Init=spectral; Iters=200 (Sec.4.3).

#Beam Quality Metrics

Extract reported beam quality metrics with numbers and units; include ROI if specified and whether values are simulated or measured. If multiple are present, separate by semicolons. Format: PSL=<dB>; ISLR=<dB>; HPBW=<deg>; contrast=<value> (Context=<ROI, sim/testbed>) (p./Fig./Sec.). Example: PSL=−13.2 dB; HPBW=0.9 deg (Context=simulated, far field) (Fig.4).

#ISAC Coupling & Metrics

State how sensing and communication are combined (waveform reuse, TDM, FDM, CDM, other) and list the key ISAC metrics with values where available, such as rate, range resolution, velocity resolution, ROC operating point, CRB. Format: Coupling=<mode>; Metrics=<rate; range; velocity; ROC; CRB with values if given> (p./Fig./Sec.). Example: Coupling=reuse-OFDM; Metrics=rate 3.2 Gbps; range res 7.5 cm; ROC PD=0.92@PFA=1e−3 (Sec.5).

#Hardware Maturity & Safety/Power

Record hardware maturity level (simulation, prototype in lab, field trial, product) and any safety or power-budget information such as IEC 60825 class and optical power in mW/dBm. If absent, write NA for each missing element. Format: Maturity=<level>; Safety=<IEC class or NA>; Power=<value or NA> (p./Fig./Sec.). Example: Maturity=prototype (lab); Safety=IEC 60825 Class 1M; Power=350 mW (p.2).

## Assessment Guidelines

### Rating Criteria

**Low Risk:**
- All signaling questions answered "Yes" or "Probably yes"
- Minor concerns that are unlikely to bias results
- High confidence in study validity

**Some Concerns:**
- Mix of positive and negative responses to signaling questions
- Moderate concerns that may introduce some bias
- Reasonable confidence in study validity with reservations

**High Risk:**
- Multiple signaling questions answered "No" or "Probably no"
- Serious concerns that are likely to bias results significantly
- Low confidence in study validity

### Special Considerations for OWISAC Studies

1. **Simulation Studies:** Assess realism of models and assumptions
2. **Experimental Studies:** Evaluate practical implementation challenges
3. **Theoretical Studies:** Check mathematical rigor and proof completeness
4. **Hybrid Studies:** Assess consistency between different methodological components

### Documentation Requirements

- All judgments must be supported by specific evidence from the study
- Quotes from the paper should be included where relevant
- Missing information should be clearly distinguished from negative findings
- Uncertain assessments should be flagged for potential author contact

# PRISMA Statement Resources (PRISMA 2020)

This folder centralizes key resources to ensure your review stays aligned with **PRISMA 2020** standards.

## What's here
- **links.md** — Curated, official links (PRISMA 2020 Statement, checklists, flow-diagram tools, PROSPERO, GRADE, OSF).
- Reference to the full template set in `/templates/`:
  - `PRISMA_2020_Complete_Guide.md` — Complete, practical guide to the 27-item checklist and workflow.
  - `Implementation_Roadmap.md` — A 24-week, quality-checked implementation plan.
  - `PROSPERO_Registration_Template.md` — Pre-filled registration scaffold.
  - `Data_Extraction_Template.md` — Domain-tailored data extraction schema (OWISAC).
  - `Risk_of_Bias_Assessment_Template.md` — Risk-of-bias tool adapted for ISAC studies.
  - `GRADE_Assessment_Template.md` — Certainty-of-evidence assessment template.

## How to use
1. Register your protocol (PROSPERO/OSF) using the templates.
2. Keep the PRISMA 2020 checklist open while drafting Methods/Results.
3. Generate/update the PRISMA flow as counts evolve (see repository `scripts/`).
4. Archive all search strings, excluded lists, and decisions for full transparency.

## Versioning
These materials track the **PRISMA 2020** update. If you later adopt an extension (e.g., PRISMA-ScR), add a note here with links and any deviations from the base checklist.
